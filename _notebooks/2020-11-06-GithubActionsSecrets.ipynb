    "**What is NBDEV?**  [NBDev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) is a development environment for python.  It allows for \"Real\" development in jupyter notebooks that will automatically build documentation, run tests, and build the library based on those notebooks.  All code, tests, and documentation is written in Jupyter Notebooks and the rest is automated to convert it into the appropriate formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a Github Action?**  A github action is a piece of code that you run on a specific trigger.  For example, when updates are committed to Github, NBDev runs all the notebooks (which includes tests) to ensure that all tests still pass."
